Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in source code during software development. 
It's widely used for collaboration, maintaining version history, and managing code across teams.

### **Key Concepts in Git**
1. **Repository (Repo)**:
   - A Git repository is where your project and its history are stored.
   - It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server like GitHub or GitLab).

2. **Commit**:
   - A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time.
   - Each commit has a unique ID (hash) and typically includes a message describing the changes.

3. **Branch**:
   - A branch is a separate line of development.
   - The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`.
   - You can create new branches to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

4. **Merge**:
   - Combines changes from one branch into another.
   - Can result in conflicts if two branches have conflicting changes to the same file.

5. **Clone**:
   - A copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

6. **Stage**:
   - Files are added to the staging area when they are ready to be committed.

7. **Pull and Push**:
   - **Pull**: Download changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
   - **Push**: Upload your local commits to a remote repository.

8. **Remote**:
   - The online location of your repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

### **Basic Git Commands**
1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   Creates a new Git repository in your project folder.

2. **Clone a Remote Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Copies a remote repository to your local machine.

3. **Check Repository Status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Shows changes in the working directory and staging area.

4. **Add Files to Staging Area**:
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git add .  # Add all changes
   ```
   Prepares files for the next commit.

5. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
   Creates a snapshot of your staged changes.

6. **View Commit History**:
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

7. **Create a New Branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch <branch_name>
   ```

8. **Switch Between Branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch_name>
   # or
   git switch <branch_name>
   ```

9. **Merge a Branch**:
   ```bash
   git merge <branch_name>
   ```

10. **Push Changes to Remote**:
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch_name>
    ```

11. **Pull Changes from Remote**:
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

12. **Discard Changes**:
    ```bash
    git restore <file>
    ```

### **Git Workflow Example**
1. **Create or Clone a Repo**:
   ```bash
   git init
   # or
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Make Changes**:
   Edit files in your project.

3. **Stage Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to Remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Collaborate**:
   Pull changes from the remote repo:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

**simple example** to demonstrate how Git works:

### **Scenario**: You want to track changes for a new project.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### 1. **Initialize a Git Repository**
Create a new folder for your project and initialize Git.

```bash
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
```
This sets up an empty Git repository in the folder.

---

#### 2. **Create a File**
Create a new file and write some content in it.

```bash
echo "Hello, Git!" > file.txt
```

---

#### 3. **Check the Repository Status**
See which files are untracked.

```bash
git status
```

Output:
```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        file.txt
```

---

#### 4. **Stage the File**
Add the file to the staging area.

```bash
git add file.txt
```

Check the status again:

```bash
git status
```

Output:
```
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   file.txt
```

---

#### 5. **Commit the File**
Save your changes to the repository.

```bash
git commit -m "Add file.txt with initial content"
```

---

#### 6. **Make Changes to the File**
Edit the file to add more content.

```bash
echo "This is a simple Git example." >> file.txt
```

Check the status:

```bash
git status
```

Output:
```
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        modified:   file.txt
```

---

#### 7. **Stage and Commit Again**
Add the changes to the staging area and commit them.

```bash
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Update file.txt with more content"
```

---

#### 8. **View the Commit History**
See the history of your commits.

```bash
git log
```

Output:
```
commit <hash>
Author: Your Name <your_email@example.com>
Date:   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

    Update file.txt with more content

commit <hash>
Author: Your Name <your_email@example.com>
Date:   YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

    Add file.txt with initial content
```

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a way to propose changes you've made on one branch to be merged into another branch, typically the main branch, in a Git repository. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a PR on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

---

### **Step-by-Step: Create a Pull Request**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
If you haven’t already, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

---

#### **2. Create a New Branch**
Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps the `main` or `master` branch clean.

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

---

#### **3. Make Changes**
Edit files or add new files to your project, then stage and commit your changes:

```bash
# Example: Make changes to a file
echo "New feature!" >> feature.txt

# Stage the changes
git add feature.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add feature.txt with new feature"
```

---

#### **4. Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository**
Push your branch to the remote repository so others can see your changes.

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

---

#### **5. Create the Pull Request**
Now go to the Git repository platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to create the PR:

1. Navigate to the **repository page** in your browser.
2. You will see a suggestion to create a pull request for your new branch. Click the **Compare & Pull Request** button, or manually navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click **New Pull Request**.
3. Select your **source branch** (e.g., `my-feature-branch`) and the **target branch** (e.g., `main`).
4. Add a **title** and description for your PR.
   - The title should summarize the change.
   - The description should explain what the PR does, why it's needed, and any additional context.

---

#### **6. Submit the PR**
Click **Create Pull Request**. Your PR is now submitted, and collaborators can review your code.

---

### **Additional Steps**
- **Review Feedback**: If collaborators leave comments or request changes, update your branch locally, commit the fixes, and push again:
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  git commit -m "Address feedback on feature"
  git push origin my-feature-branch
  ```
- The PR will automatically update with your new commits.

- **Merge the PR**: Once approved, the PR can be merged. This can be done by you or the repository maintainer, depending on the project settings.
